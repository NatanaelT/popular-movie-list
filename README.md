## General considerations
  This was done for a interview test which consists in:
  - Listing popular movies from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
  - Infinite scroll
  - Search in every page with 500ms debounce method
  - Show movies detailed info

## What was used in this project
   - Next.js
   - React
   - MUI
   - Axios
   - Redux Toolkit
   - Typescript
 
## References
   - [Infinite Scroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZKUirTtxcg&t=1s)
   - [Debounce Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PySFIsgXNZ0&t=848s)

## Final considerations
  There's still room for (a lot) improvements, like useMoviesSearch and useDebounce hooks that were created using the references above, but could've been easier implemented with libraries like lodash, but for studie pourposes chose to do with "my own hands". Also created components using some differents approachs about how to style it. Some components are styled with css modules and another styled with SX props from MUI and in the future, I pretend to use SCSS/SASS and maybe StyledComponents.  Also, i'm pretty sure that there's some opmitizations that could've been done and I pretend to do it. 

Overall, it was a fun time ðŸ˜Š
